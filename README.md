# Rewardify: Achieve Your Goals, Smartly

Rewardify is a groundbreaking mobile app designed to empower users to take control of their spending habits while achieving personal goals. At its core, Rewardify encourages responsible spending and goal attainment by transforming the way users make purchases.

## How it Works

Rewardify revolves around the concept of personal challenges. Users start by creating a Wishlist within the app, where they can catalogue items they desire to purchase. For each item added, users provide essential details, including the item's name, a purchase link, cost, and category (e.g., clothing, home, tech/gadget, books, etc.).

When ready, users can browse their Wishlist and choose an item they wish to acquire. Instead of making an impulsive purchase, users select this item as a reward to be earned through a self-imposed challenge. This process fosters responsible financial decisions and encourages users to reconsider the value of their desired items.

## Setting Challenges

Users can create new challenges with their chosen item as the ultimate reward. They have the flexibility to define the challenge's rules, such as daily or weekly objectives that must be met to progress. These objectives align with their broader goals, such as practicing daily yoga, saving money, or other personal achievements.

## Tracking Progress

Rewardify provides a seamless way for users to log their progress. For example, in the case of the yoga mat, users can record their daily yoga sessions within the app. A progress bar visually tracks their journey, making it easy to see how close they are to achieving their goal.

## Reaping the Reward

Once the user successfully meets the challenge requirements, they are rewarded with the ability to purchase the desired item. This unique approach reinforces the value of the item, making the act of finally acquiring it even more gratifying.

## Why Rewardify?

Rewardify is more than just a budgeting app; it's a smart spending companion that encourages mindfulness and discipline in spending habits. By reframing the purchasing process as a reward for personal achievements, users gain a new perspective on their financial choices. Rewardify empowers individuals to make deliberate, thoughtful decisions about their purchases, leading to improved financial health and a greater sense of accomplishment.
